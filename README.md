# oc-languages

This repo is intended to allow the collaborative translation of [OpenChat](https://oc.app) into other languages. 

If you can provide translations into a language that is not already covered and would like to help then please do the following: 

* fork this repo
* create a copy of the en.json file with a name corresponding to the language you are implementing e.g. fr.json for French
* for language variations you can use the full four character code e.g. fr-ca.json for Canadian French. 
* fill in the values for all of the keys defined in the file (replacing the copied English values). 
* create a PR back to this repo
